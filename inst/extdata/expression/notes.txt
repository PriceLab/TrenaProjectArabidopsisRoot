   In this page, we have made available the input data files and the results of our analysis 11,760
   microarray experiments on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana drawn from public repositories. We
   have categorized these experiments under seven different tissue types and five different
   experimental conditions. Using this data, we generate genome scale networks of Arabidopsis using
   three different methods - mutual information, Pearson correlation and Gaussian graphical
   modeling.

   Description of Data Files

   In this page, we have made available both the datasets and the generated output networks.

   Datasets All the twelve classified datasets (7 tissues ; 5 conditions) are can be downloaded from
   here . The dataset files are of the "exp" format. exp is a plain text format. It has (No. of
   experiments + 2) columns and (No. of genes + 3) rows. The first two columns contain the probe set
   name and the locus id (Arabidopsis Genome Identifier or AGI). From the third column onwards, each
   column contains the expression values corresponding to an experiment.

   The rows are organized as follows: First row is a header; second and third rows are
   descriptions. Starting from the fourth row, each row is a vector to the expression values
   corresponding to a gene. The first two entries in each row are the probe id and the AGI (of the
   form ATXGXXXX) are respectively. The locus id value can use used to select the rows corresponding
   to the genes of interest.
